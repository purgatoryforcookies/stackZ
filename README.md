## Getting started

When you start StackZ firs time, it creates your first stack for you.

Change terminal settings by typing commands into a stopped terminal, or edit the settings from terminal dropdowns. Or by editing the JSON file.

### Environments

On the left side, you've got OS Environments that come straight from your machine. They're the first ones in line, always. If you've got keys with the same name between different env sets, the new ones take over. It's like battle royale, the last key wins.

You can mute a single ENV with a right-click or mute a whole set from the toolbar. Muted variables lowkey gets just ghosted. And if you want to make changes to the list, you've gotta switch to edit mode.
