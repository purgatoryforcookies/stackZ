# StackZ


StackZ's purpose is to make it easy to pick up and start an environment for development and automation purposes. It works by letting you store a stack of terminals ready to be spawned either individually or as a whole. Each stack and terminal can be configured in variety of ways to make it possible to store as many differrent kind of projects as possible. The goal is to have reproducable environments that always start within a click of a button, once it is initially configured.

Switching between differrent projects becomes faster and easier, letting you get into it with less.
