# About

StackZ's purpose is to make it easy to pick up and start an environment for development and automation purposes.
It works by letting you store a *stack* of terminals ready to be spawned either individually or as a whole.
Each stack and terminal can be configured in variety of ways to make it possible to store as many differrent kind of projects as possible. 
The goal is to have reproducable environments that always start within a click of a button, once it is initially configured. 

Switching between differrent projects becomes faster and easier, letting you get into it with less.

## Features

- Run processes in a sequence or individually
- Health checks, delays and halts in stack mode
- Local legends only: No user accounts, emails, logins and no user metrics.
- Git widget: Pull and switch branches for easy PR review
- Hotkeys and CMD+K menu
- Themes
- Code completion from your hosts bash/zsh/ps history
- Configurable working directories on terminal level
- Search for terminal output
- Input sequencing (in beta)

Each terminal process is a child process of stackZ. If stackZ closes, all of the terminals exit too.

## Getting Started

Clone the repo and build from source.

Or download assets from the latest **[Release](https://github.com/purgatoryforcookies/stackZ/releases)**.


### What you'll need

Building from source requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Development and tests are run on v21.


### First steps

When you run stackZ for the first time, a default stack is created for you. 
You can start working from there or delete the default one and start from scratch.

If you did not build the app from source, you're met with security warnings from your OS.
